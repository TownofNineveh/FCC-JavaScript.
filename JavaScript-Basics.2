// Second Lesson is on scopes of variable. 
In JavaScript, scope refers to the visibility of variables. Variables which are defined outside of a function block have Global scope. This means, they can be seen everywhere in your JavaScript code.

Variables which are declared without the let or const keywords are automatically created in the global scope. This can create unintended consequences elsewhere in your code or when running a function again. You should always declare your variables with let or const.

Using let or const, declare a global variable named myGlobal outside of any function. Initialize it with a value of 10.

Inside function fun1, assign 5 to oopsGlobal without using the var, let or const keywords.//

Global scope: The variable is available throughout the code
Local scope: Available in only a certain area (like only within function)
Block scope: Available within an even more certain area (like an if-statement)


// Declare the myGlobal variable below this line
****const myGlobal = 10;

function fun1() {
  // Assign 5 to oopsGlobal here

}
****oopsGlobal = 5;
// Only change code above this line

function fun2() {
  let output = "";
  if (typeof myGlobal != "undefined") {
    output += "myGlobal: " + myGlobal;
  }
  if (typeof oopsGlobal != "undefined") {
    output += " oopsGlobal: " + oopsGlobal;
  }
  console.log(output);
}

// for the second test I am exemplifying how any variable assigned in a function is a local variable to that function and will be called error
if the variable is called outside of the function... in the next test when I call for the var associated with the function it will output a 5, as myVar = 5
and its called fo rin the console.log. meaning it myLocalScope displays what myVar is = too inside the function. HOWEVER when called outside of the function myVar
is undefined as it is only associated with the preceeding function.//

function myLocalScope() {
  // Only change code below this line
****const myVar = 5;
  console.log('inside myLocalScope', myVar);
}
myLocalScope();

// Run and check the console
// myVar is not defined outside of myLocalScope
console.log('outside myLocalScope', myVar);
 
 
 
 // In the next example it will show how it works if variables share names i.e. global and local both being "outerWear" in the following code. 
 local variable in a function superceeds any global when displaying the functions result.// Side note dont forget the Return Statement with functions
 
 
 // Setup
const outerWear = "T-Shirt";

function myOutfit() {
  // Only change code below this line
****const outerWear = "sweater";
  // Only change code above this line
  return outerWear;
}

myOutfit();



// This next lesson should display how you can use multiple local variables to affect a global variable.//

Example

let sum = 0;

function addSum(num) {
  sum = sum + num;
}

addSum(3);

// addSum is a function without a return statement. The function will change the global sum variable but the returned value of the function is undefined.
This works because addSum gets described later as the function equating to 3.... thus  = addSum = (sum = sum + numb).//

With my example I already have a defined sum = sum + 3 meaning if I ran this without adding my line of code it would give me sum = 3 and sum = undefined as
there still is no return. however if I add sa secondary function with sum += 5 i am constenating the sum to +5. thus when when the code is finaly ran 
it is sum = Sum +3 +5 or sum =8 and if addFive or addThree are called they will all be undefined.

// Setup
let sum = 0;

function addThree() {
  sum = sum + 3;
}

// Only change code below this line
function addFive() {
****   sum += 5
}

// Only change code above this line

addThree();
addFive();

/////This next one is very important as it shows a great way we can use a function and call for results. 
If you'll recall from our discussion about Storing Values with the Assignment Operator, everything to the right of the equal sign
is resolved before the value is assigned. This means we can take the return value of a function and assign it to a variable.//

// Setup
let processed = 0;

function processArg(num) {
  return (num + 3) / 5;
}

// Only change code below this line
*****processed = processArg(7); 

for this one I chose to call for processed... I ask the console what would the process look like if I ran the argument with a num = 7.
With this done it outputs a value of 2.
